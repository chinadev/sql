## Golang database/sql API with Multi Result Set support.

This is a dirty hack to golang's database/sql package. Yes, its dirty until golang provide its offical way to support multResultSet returned by stored procedure (or multi statements).

The motivation to create this package, comes from that the standard database/sql package lacks the support for Multi ResultSet feature. This is not a big issue for common usage, but for users who using stored procedures, they will encounter "Command out of sync" error. 

Developers of `go-sql-driver/mysql` has confirmed that they cannot support this feature until golang's database API change first.

So I made this dirty hack, an independent package named `databasex` to avoid name conflicts.

### API Changes
- **`database/sql/Rows`** type added one method.

```go
	// Sibling forward the next result set in current context.
	//
	// To support multi result set feature, append clientMultiResults=true
	// to DSN string passed to sql.Open()
	//
	// Currently only support stored procedure to generate multi resultsets,
	// using multi statements also possible , welcome to contribue ;-ï¼‰
	func (rs *Rows) Sibling() bool 
   ```
   
- **`database/sql/driver/Rows`** interface added 2 methods.
```go
	// MoreResults returns if there are other result sets exists
	//
	// After iterate the current result set and Next() returns false,
	// then call this method to determine if there are some onther result
	// sets exists, if it does, call Sibling to change to that Rows.
	MoreResults() bool

	// Sibling is called to pululate multi results in one query.
	//
	// Sibling should return io.EOF when there are no more results
	Sibling() (Rows, error)
```

### Modifications
This hack based on the following code:

1. source code of **`database/sql`** package from golang 1.5
   - add a Sibling() method for sql.Rows type.
   - add MoreResults() / Sibling() method to driver.Rows interface
2. source code of **`go-sql-driver/mysql`** based on commit: 3dd7008ac1529aca1bcd8a9db75228a71ba23cac
  - implement the sql.driver.Rows interfaces

All modifications are listed in the orig.diff file in both sql and mysql repo.

- [Changes to go-sql-driver/mysql pakcage](https://github.com/databasex/mysql/blob/master/orig.diff)

### Usage 

1. `go get -u github.com/databasex/sql`
2. `go get -u github.com/databasex/mysql`
3. replace `database/sql` and `_ go-sql-driver/mysql` imports with **`databasex/sql`** and **`_ databasex/mysq`**
4. using **`mysqlx`** as the driver type when calling sql.Open() function, and append `"&clientMultiResults=true"` to your DSN.
